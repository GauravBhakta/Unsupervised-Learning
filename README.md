# Unsupervised-Learning
This simple project is my first step on Machine Learning where I have learned how to implement K-Means and Hiverichal Clusterring in Python for clustering.

# Dataset
I have worked with the famous iris dataset from netj which contains two different files, train.csv that contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, and test.csv that contains similar information but does not disclose Survived information for each passenger. 
And this dataset is considered as the studentâ€™s first step in machine learning.

This code works on iris.csv file, where we apply Unsupervised learning and find out the accuracy of the data with x1 = petal.length and x2 = petal.width and later x3 = sepal.width

```import dataset```

```df = pd.read_csv("D:/iris.csv")```

```import
